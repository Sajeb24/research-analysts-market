This growth can be attributed to innovations in formulation technology, increasing online sales channels, and the sustained popularity of natural and organic ingredients. The segment catering to personalized skincare solutions is also becoming a driving force in the market, as consumers seek products tailored to their specific skin types and concerns.</p>    <p>The influence of social media and beauty influencers cannot be understated, as they play a critical role in shaping consumer behavior and preferences.
